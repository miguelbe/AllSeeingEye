###lab 4: modelling software requirements

#### A. Get familiar with software requirements specification (SRS) documentation

**1. Find existing requirements documentation** e.g. by querying
 * requirements specification
 * requirements specification example pdf
 * srs pdf
 * or [here](https://gist.github.com/OAlm/f1d18c17687ba28d4b5b)
 * (Maybe too big for today; but could be interesting to check for your project: http://www.i-locate.eu/public-deliverables/)

**AVOID DUPLICATE**. Check if the SRS you found has not been already taken: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e2hjG9Fs-gl-k7V5mrX6Fz_oTahO69wWQVh2VYzFB0Q/edit And add yourself there. First come, first served. 

**2. Report the following things related to the document you found:**
 
**(Introduction)**
* What is the project?
* Overall description of the product (=what is it? can you understand it?)
* Target audience (of the document)?
* The situation? Motivation?
* Structure
  * Compare the structure of the document with the template provided for the course group work. How does it differ? Is there more? Less? (check also the contents and structure of SRS provided in Wikipedia:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification). 

**(Use cases)**
* What the system (will) do?
* Use case diagram?
* Actors?
* How cases are described, how much details?

**(General structure of the system)**
* What chart techniques are used? Why?

**(Functional & non-functional requirements)**
* Listed?
* Measurable/traceability? (is it possible to check from the upcoming end product if a feature / requirement is implemented or not?)

**(How does (will) it look?)**
* UI examples / views?
* Are the pictures mockups or screenshots from existing system?
* Transitions between views

**(Process model? [might not exist, some times in a separate document called â€˜project planâ€™])**
* Allocation of resources / budget?
* Risk Analysis?

**(Your point of view)**
* Is it a good/bad document? Why?
* Consider also the quality of diagrams / illustrations
* Do you think there would be enough information for you to build that system?
* Etc.

##### Return a link of your github repo to Tuubi. Don't forget to put a link to the document you analyzed. 

After the deadline, the tuubi assignment will be made public, so everyone could benefit from your analysis.

##### You will do a small (5min) group presentation for the class of your analysis.

### B. Start your project :)

The idea is to benefit from your (and/or other group) analysis:
* Do you get an idea how and what to write?
* At the content level, is there parts that you would simplify or go into more details?
* Do you think that you are able to list functional requirements? Non-functional requirements (and make them measurable)?
* What is the importance of the illustrations/diagrams/mock-ups?
* How much "technical" vocabulary should be?
* Etc.
